          <p>With a grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray Eames turned their curiosity and <br> boundless enthusiasm into creations that established them as a truly great husband and wife <br>design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture. Lean and modern.<br>Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple. That was and is the <br> "Eames look".</p>
          <img src="../visual_arts/img/chair1.png">
          <p>That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in <br>the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames lounge chair, now in the permanent <br> collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p>
          <p>Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project the same <br> way: Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it better?</p>

          </div>
          <p>The loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architecture, <br>process and product, style and function. "The details are not details", said Charles. "They <br>make the product".</p>

            <p>Their own concepts evolved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the <br>development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs, "Yes, it was a flash of inspiration", he said, "a <br>kind of 30-year flash".</p>
            <p>A design critic ounce said that this extraordinary couple "just wanted to make the world a <br>better place". That they did. Tsat also made it a lot more interesting.</p>
